              How would I know if my venue is suitable?
            </h2>
            <p>
              Is it in a reasonably central city location,or significant suburb or a tourist resort?<br>
              Does it have a minimum of 200 square meters/2,000 square feet?<br>
              Is it a reasonably open plan design?<br>
              Does it have or the potential to have a smoking area, which is not on the street?<br>

            <h2>
              What will it cost to redesign my venue to include coworking activities during the day?

            <p>
              That will depend on each venue, and the costs per location, but in general it will be anywhere between 50k and 100k Euro equivalent.
