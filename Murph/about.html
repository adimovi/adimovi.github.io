            <p><b>Barry Murphy originally from The Republic of Ireland</b> has a lifetime history of designing and creating businesses in different countries worldwide, including in the pub/club industry.</p>
            <p>Here are Barry’s thoughts on Murph’s Coworking Pubs in his own words:</p>
            <p>Hi, the first major point to make here is that the coworking space industry is not lucrative in its present form, as we have seen from the inevitable collapse of Wework. 
              The reason it’s not a lucrative business is because coworking space operators are paying too much rent for office space, and in most cases they require over 90% occupancy to make a margin.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              At the same time, there are some fantastic night time entertainment venues in great locations, which with a little redesign work could also be used during the day as coworking spaces, with a great casual vibe.
            </p>

            <img src="./imgs/barry.jpg" class="" style="width: 100%;">
        </div>
          <div class="col-12 bg-white shadow my-5 p-lg-4">
             <p>I have completed a lot of research on my continuous global travels, and realised that some of these entertainment venues in certain locations have an ideal opportunity to seriously increase their revenue with very little investment. 
              This will also create a unique global social community for quality coworking customer members to enjoy wherever they land, or even in their home location, where they will be continuously be exposed to members from different cultures and backgrounds who are on the move.
              </p>
             <p>In Ireland many moons ago, you would find a filling station on a main road, and a few miles further a small shop. Then some genius came up with the idea of combining the two businesses in one location instead of two, saving on overheads big time while at the same time, making life much more convenient for the customer.</p>
             <p>I had a business in Ireland, which my son is now running, where we collect cattle hides from abattoirs in trucks that were designed for the waste industry. Because we were mainly using our feet of vehicles in the evenings when the production was complete in the abattoirs, I decided to use the fleet for the waste business during the day with second drivers, which of course gave us a massive competitive edge, because we already had the fleet.</p>
             <p>Murph’s Coworking Pubs is no different to the two stories above, if the venue is suitable and can be redesigned to suit our concept in any location.</p>
             <p>I also believe that the social element and vibe to working in a casual pub environment will be very appealing to a lot of coworkers, and I am looking forward to the opportunity of meeting and benefiting a lot of the venue.owners who have suitable premises in the future.</p>
