            <h2>
              Why is this such a quality concept?
              </h2>
        
              <p class="mb-0">
                Most coworking spaces  are a bad business model, given the fact that their greatest expense is office rental, which we don’t have due to the fact that the premises is already in use in the evenings.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Normal” Coworking spaces require an over 80% occupancy rate to make money, which is why the largest supplier of space globally (Wework) has gone bust, after having an initial value of over $40 billion.
              </p>

              <p>
                The other side is that our research shows that young smart people really like the idea of working in a more casual environment, due to the social interactive benefits.
              </p>

              <p>
                One other point to make is that we envisage a lot of coworkers will invite non member friends over for a beer at 8pm in the evenings, which obviously boosts the night time trade of the venue as well.
              </p>

              <h2>
                What time do the coworking pubs open for business?
              </h2>

              <p>
                It depends on local laws, but most open at 10 am, however they only serve non alcoholic drinks until 5 pm in any location.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Are our clubs exclusively for members?
              </h2>
        
              <p>
                Yes, upto 8pm each evening, and after that they are open to the general public, but members are free to continue working. It just might not be as quiet as it was before 8pm. Most coworking pubs also hold dart or board game competitions between 8pm and 10pm each evening, which helps everyone to socialise and mix. Some times, musicians will pull out an instrument after 10 pm, and start a casual acoustic  jamming session at the discretion of the proprietor. </p>

              <h2 >
                What backgrounds are most members from?
              </h2>
        
              <p >
                Some are passing through for short periods of time, some are local regulars, others are full time offering coworking colleagues legal, financial, IT, video production or marketing services as examples.
              </p>

              <h2 >
                What different types of seating arrangements are on offer?
              </h2>
        
              <p class="mb-0">
                As you can see in the design images, and approximate floor plan, there are oval high stool tables in the centre, which can accommodate 6 coworkers each, and 4 seaters around the walls, with two conference/ meeting booths.</p>
<p>
  The oval tables can actually take 12 stools for night time trade, if required.
</p>
              <h2>
                What is the cost to members of using the coworking pubs?
              </h2>
        
              <p class="mb-0">
                That varies worldwide obviously, but a full day pass is approximately the same price you would normally pay for 4 coffees on the high street in any location, and unlimited coffee is free with each day pass.
                 
              </p>
              <p>
                Half day passes are also available, but at 75% of the cost of a full day pass.
              </p>

              <h2 >
                Can members reserve a space in advance or for long periods of time on an ongoing basis?
              </h2>
        
              <p >
                Yes, they can, but because we continuously keep our pricing as competitive as possible, we don’t offer long term discounts
              </p>

              <h2 >
                What kind of vibe can members expect in each coworking pub?
              </h2>
        
              <p>
                Very relaxed and easygoing, but excessive noise is not allowed between opening times and 8pm.</p>

                <p>We keep numbers limited up to 8pm, so that everyone has space to work in comfort. </p>
                <p>Many members stay on in the evenings for a few drinks with coworking colleagues, which sometimes leads to romantic relationships!</p>

              <h2>
                Do the pubs sell food?
              </h2>
        
              <p>
                Yes, but very basic. Soup, sandwiches, pitza or make up a salad from the salad buffet. Members can not order in food online, or bring their own.
              </p>

              <h2>
                What IT infrastructure is in place in each pub?
              </h2>
        
              <p>
                We guarantee the highest internet speed available in any location, plus electric power points drop from the ceiling to each coworking space until 8pm each evening.
              </p>

              <h2>
                What time do the coworking pubs close each evening?
              </h2>
        
              <p>
                That depends on local licencing laws, or at the discretion of the proprietor.
              </p>

              <h2>
                Do the coworking pubs offer any other services?
              </h2>
        
              <p class="mb-0">
                Yes. Many will have local tour guides available for members who are passing through, plus every club offers local recommendations for value accomodation at different budget levels. 
                We do not take commission on these recommendations, nor do we book accommodation for members. They are purely based on local knowledge for the benefit of our travelling members.

    My day starts at 8 am working online from home with my Asian customers for two hours. At 10 am I usually go to the gym, for a run, or a swim, followed by brunch and a couple of hours relaxing.
</p>
<p>
    At 2 pm, I go to my local coworking pub, and work with my European and American customers until around 7 pm, at which point I down tools and socialise with my fellow coworkers over a board game and a few drinks.
</p>
<p class="mb-0">
    Usually, I am home by around 10 pm, and I love the balance of my lifestyle, as well as the many interesting diverse friends I have made from our coworking pub.

    I met my boyfriend in my local coworking pub in Boston three years ago, and we are now married. Both of us still work most days from our coworking pub three years later, and we have a fantastic circle of close friends, plus there is always new characters coming and going with their life stories.
</p>
<p>
    We often organise group events/trips or activities at weekends, and we love the fact that life is never ever boring.
