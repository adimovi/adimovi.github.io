      <div class="row py-5">

<div class="col-lg-7 col-12">
 <h3>
  What type of people join Spice Clubs?
 </h3>
 
 <p>
  Classy, Intelligent, Non judgemental, Presentable, Respectful, Sociable, and Approachable.
 </p>

 <p>
  One never knows who they will meet in a Spice club, but they can be sure they will be interesting.
 </p>

 <h3>
  What types of relationships are members looking for?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Who knows, or who cares. Ask fellow members when you join and visit. That’s part of the excitement that keeps it all interesting. In today's world, there is too much calculated online planning, which doesn’t always work out, tends to waste a lot of time, and leaves no room for spontaneity. 
 </p>

 <h3>
  What are the clubs common rules?
 </h3>

 <p>
  Always be respectful towards other members and staff. Simple as that.
Never offer anyone sex for money or money for sex.
Casual business dress code at all times.
Mobile phones need to be on silent mode, and taking photos/videos is strictly forbidden.
 </p>

 <h3>
  Can members have sex in the clubs?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Absolutely not.
 </p>

 <h3>
  Can couples join as members?
 </h3>
 <p>
  Sure. Anyone can join subject to a 10 minute online video interview, as long as they are looking for some type of dating arrangement, and are respectful.
 </p>

 <h3 >
  How do you control the quality of members?
 </h3>
 <p >
  Our very friendly staff conduct a 10 minute online video interview with all member applicants, only to find out if they are presentable, have good positive communication skills and have at least conversational English. They do not ask potential member’s about their education, profession or any other questions which have no relevance to us.
 </p>

 <h3>
  Can LGBHN members join as members?
 </h3>
 <p >
  Sure. We don’t care what people are, we only care who they are?
  (By the way LGBHN  is our term for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Hetrosexual, Not sure)</p>

  <h3>
    Can people offering companionship or massage services join?
  </h3>
  <p>
    That’s like asking can people offering legal or architecture services join. Of course they can, as long as they are not offering sexual services for reward.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What age do you have to be to become a member?
  </h3>
  <p>
    22 years or over..
  </p>

  <h3>
    What is the cost?
  </h3>
  <p>
    25 Euro Annual Membership fee. (This includes members only online access to a lot of very interesting lifestyle and design content plus access to our club booking system). 
20 Euro equivalent for any club visit globally, which includes 2 free drinks. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Do Members have online profiles?
  </h3>
  <p>
    No, but they do login to our app to book a table for any club on any day.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What are the opening hours of the clubs?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Check each club page in locations for details, and some are open during the day to use as coworking spaces for members as well. 
  </p>
  <h3>
    Do you keep a gender balance in clubs?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Yes, and when you go to book a table online, you might well see a message saying we don’t have male/female capacity left for the day you selected, but please tick here if you want to be notified of changes on whatsapp. 
(Members should always click this, because the situation changes very fast, and the message you get will simply say “Birchley”. If you get this message, you will have 15 minutes to take the available space)
  </p>
  <h3>
    Are some of your members married?
  </h3>
  <p>
    None of our business.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Why would people use Spice clubs for dating instead of a dating app?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Many, but not all members use a combination of both, but prefer to meet in person in a Spice club because they are very sociable and safe spaces. All Spice clubs are located so that they are convenient for business, professional and vacation travelers, as well as locals of course.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What are the busiest evenings in Spice Clubs?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Due to the fact that a lot of our members are travelling for one reason or another, most evenings are busy, not like other weekend only clubs.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Can a member invite a guest?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Yes, subject to the receptionists approval upon arrival, but a guest must apply to become a member to enter any club a second time.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What happens when a member enters a Spice club?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you enter as a solo member, you will be directed to either a bar stool at the counter, or given a table for two.
Members can tell who is still up for being approached if the small light on their table is on. 
Simply approach any table with the small light on, and ask the occupant if they would like a drink. If they say yes, sit down with them and they should then turn the small light on their table off for as long as you are happy chatting, or leave the light on if you are both happy to attract other company as well.
