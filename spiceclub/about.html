          <h2>
            Hi,
          </h2>
          <p>
            I am Barry Murphy the founder of Spice Clubs, and the main reason I created this concept was because I found so many people worldwide who were sick and tired of wasting time going through the process of online dating. Searching, communicating, meeting and then repeating.
          </p>
          <p>I also realised that there were no clubs which were dedicated to dating, whether for those looking for conventional or alternative dating arrangements, and it might be time to provide such venues for quality members who are interested in some form of dating.
            A place for those who want to meet in person in a safe environment, rather than online, which is a lot more fun.</p>
          <p>I once designed, owned and operated two very successful live music venues for ten years, which makes me a great fit for designing Spice Clubs from the perspective of customer comfort, keeping costs low without compromising on quality, and lastly the ease of day to day operations for the management and staff.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">
            I am sure that all of our members will have great fun communicating in such dedicated social spaces, regardless of whether they meet the right person on any particular evening or not, because they will be sure that all other attending members are at least open to some form of relationship arrangement, which means everyone is approachable.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-12">
          <img src="./img/barry.jpg" class="d-block mx-auto" style="width: 100%;">
        </div>

      </div>
      <p>The name Spice clubs came about because I wanted to create an environment where non boring, quality people could meet to find whatever type of relationship arrangement they are looking for. The reality of modern society is that while traditional dating arrangements still exist in many cases, there are also a lot of new alternative arrangement types, which is a good thing, because people have more choices on how they would like to design their lives, including traditional of course.</p>
      <p>Spice clubs are completely non judgemental safe places for quality people looking for any type of dating arrangement to meet. Simple As.</p>
      <p>The advantages and convenience that online everything has created are enormous across many different sectors, but it has also led to a serious lack of real human communication and isolation, which can’t be good for society in the long term.</p>
      <p>For those of you who don’t know, the word Pub is short for Public House. Think about those two words for a second. A house that’s for the public. Being Irish, I grew up in an era that whichever pub you walked into for a beer, you always got chatting to someone, and learned something from each other. People went there for a chat, and often not knowing who they were going to meet, where all patrons were approachable.</p>
      <p>Spice clubs aims to resurrect that simple formula worldwide for quality people looking for some form of dating relationship, where everyone is approachable and having fun.</p>
