            Thailand:

          <p>More availability of quality accommodation.</p>
          <p>Easier access with direct overnight flights to The UK.</p>
          <p>Better infrastructure in general.</p>
          <p>Not so many English speakers outside the tourist areas.</p>
          <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">A fantastic selection and choice of food options.</p>

              The Philippines:
            </p>
            <p>Most people speak fluent English.</p>
            <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">Probably about 20% less expensive than Thailand, with the exception of accommodation, which is similar to Thailand, or maybe even slightly more expensive.</p>

              Again in Barry’s words:
            </p>
            <p><b>I selected Jomtien and/or East Pattaya in Thailand</b> after staying in quite a few locations for the following reasons:
              </p>
            <p>1. There is plentiful quality accommodation resources at affordable rates, and it is right on the coastline.</p>
            <p>2. There is a very large expat community residing there, so it's very easy to find company.</p>
            <p>3. There are something in the region of 18 golf courses in the immediate area, and a lot of expat golf society options for those who are into golf.</p>
            <p>4. It’s only 2 hours by private taxi from Bangkok airport, which we look after on your arrival.</p>
            <p>5. There are numerous top quality private medical facilities within 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
            <p>6. The shopping malls are excellent and have all the brands you are used to at home.</p>
            <p>7. You can live as quite or wild a life as you wish, all within a couple of miles radius.</p>
            <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">8.There are lots of attractions to visit in the area including the local Islands.</p>

          (Hua Hin would have been a close second choice in Thailand, but it doesn’t have as much to offer.)

          <div class="col-12">
            <p><b>I selected Cebu in The Philippines</b> after staying in quite a few locations for the following reasons:
              </p>
            <p>1. It has some of the best private medical facilities in The Philippines.</p>
            <p>2. There is a very large expat community residing there, so it's very easy to find company.</p>
            <p>3. The only other real option apart from the provinces would have been Manilla, but it is simply too big and congested, as well as being more expensive.</p>
            <p>4. Cebu has an international airport with good connectivity.</p>
            <p>5. The shopping malls are excellent and have all the brands you are used to at home.</p>
            <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">6. There are lots of attractions to visit in the area including the local Islands.</p>

        <h3 class=" pt-3 my-0">
          (Davao would have been a close second choice in The Philippines, but it doesn’t have as much to offer.
Many expats also relocate to Dumaguete, but medical facilities are not great and it is prone to a lot of power cuts and internet down time, like a lot of provincial areas in The Philippines.)

          <div class="col-12">
           
            <p>Overall, I would prefer Jomtien/East Pattay in Thailand than Cebu in The Philippines for many reasons, but trying to find quality dating or nursing companions who speak reasonable English in Thailand is a definite challenge at times.
              </p>
            
            <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">We do the best we can without ever compromising on quality, and are even looking at the option of relocating Philippine companions to Thailand, but this too has challenges when it comes to long term visas and/or work permits, which we are trying to overcome in the simplest way possible.</p>
