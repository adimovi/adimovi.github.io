        Our standard relocation service costs 1,500 euro, and includes the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Initial introduction conversation by telephone or video call with Barry Murphy the founder of Asia Companion Relocations.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. A telephone/video introduction to our experienced representative on the ground in your destination of choice.</p>
      <p>
        3. Introductions online to a few of our carefully selected companions, until you seem satisfied with one of them, which of course can change on the ground.</p>
      
      <p>
        4. Rental property selection assistance. There are two ways to go about this. The first is that you select a property for a one year contract before you travel, 
        which is very safe, because we will give you all of the pros and cons regarding any property.<br class="d-lg-block d-none"> We are not property agents, so there is absolutely no benefit to us to recommend a property to our clients, without telling them all the facts about it.
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
        The second option is to rent an apartment for one or two months, and we can then assist you to find a long term option, when you are on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        5. We have an inhouse health insurance expert with a medical background who will go through your options to make sure that you are adequately covered for private care in your destination country.
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
This could involve upgrading or downgrading an existing policy you already have, or taking out a new policy in combination with the one you have. All circumstances are different.
<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
Again, we are not representing any health insurance companies, and the only role we play is to ensure our clients have the most suitable cover in place as affordably as possible, which is part of the standard service we offer.</p>
      <p>
        6. We can advise on the best flight options for your travel, which might not always be the cheapest. 
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">For example, an overnight direct flight that costs 100 Euro more might be way better value than a stop over day time flight. 
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
        We do not book flights for clients, we just give them what we consider to be the best options. 
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
        We always look after private airport transfers to your selected property when you land, as part of our standard services.</p>
      <p>
        7. Our friendly local representative will always meet you at your property upon arrival at any time of the day or night. They will already have made sure that you have the basics for the first day/night of your stay, which includes, tea, coffee, milk, sugar, biscuits, water and some fresh fruit.</p>
      <p>
        8. Our staff will also give you a one full day tour guide service, which includes things like showing you how to get to the local shopping mall, introducing you to a few local expats in the best hostileries, or anything else you want to know, 
        like the best restaurants, introduction to a local GP or dentist, or getting a new sim card/internet package and opening a local bank account assistance etc.
        <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
       The one day tour can also be broken into two half days, if that's what the client prefers.</p> 
        <p>9. As part of our standard service, we also offer advice when it comes to long term visa options.</p>
       <p class="bold mb-0">What our standard relocation service does not offer:</p>
       <p class="mb-0">
        Any further assistance that is required like translation services, or attending medical appointments or actual visa applications, or offering advice on any topic we can help with, like booking a car rental, just as an example.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
Most extra services are charged out to clients at a rate of between 10 and 15 euro per hour, depending on the task, but in all cases the client knows they have someone experienced on the ground they can completely trust to assist sorting out any issue that might arise.

      <p>At the end of the day, it is our task to make sure that our clients relocation process is as seamless and stress free as humanly possible.</p>
      <p>Companion, property, health insurance, transfers, introductions, local tour and off you go from there to enjoy life, knowing we have your back locally if you need us at any time.</p>
      <p>The making of a successful business is based on word of mouth and recommendations, and we are totally ok with that.</p>
