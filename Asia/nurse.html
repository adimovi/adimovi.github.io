            Nurse Companions:
          </h3>
            <p>The first thing we need to point out here is that even though we refer to nurse companions, they are actually qualified nurses aides, and not fully qualified nurses.
              We can also provide fully qualified nurses, if required by a client.</p>
            <p class="bold mb-0">Could a nurse companion become a dating companion?</p>
            <p>Of course that is a possibility, but for sure not expected and any client who requires a nurse companion is obligated to provide a separate bedroom.</p>
            <p class="bold mb-0">What are the obligations of a live-in nurse companion?</p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Unlike other live-in nurse providers, we expect our nurse companions to be happy to attend social functions with our clients or go on excursions, as requested, as well as look after the home and whatever medical needs they are qualified to execute.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">We look for good empathic natured nurse companions who have a very warm and positive type of attitude to life.</p>
