    Accommodation in Thailand
  </h3>

      <p>
        In Jomtien or East Pattaya, Thailand there are two main accommodation options within the same 500/700 Euro budget, and it really depends on a client’s lifestyle preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is a quality apartment in the centre of Jomtien, which often has sea views, and in walking distance to nearly everything. All of these quality apartment blocks also have very good communal swimming pools, and gymnasiums
      </p>
      <p>
        The second option is a private villa in East Pattaya, often with its own pool, and always in a gated community or village as they call them over here. This option is usually 10 to 15 minutes outside the main hub, but that’s not a big obstacle because Taxis are so cheap, if you don’t have a car.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our opinion, depending on your lifestyle it doesn’t make a lot of sense to have a car, and it’s very easy to rent one for a couple of days as required, if you want to travel around.
      </p>
      <p>Keep life as simple as possible at all times is our motto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking about keeping life simple, we believe it is not the right thing for a foreigner to buy property in Asia in general, and here is why:<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
The legal system in many Asian countries is not the same as back home, and a lot of guys can get stuck with properties that they find difficult to sell afterwards for various reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is much better to keep your home in your country of origin and rent it out, knowing that you have secure tenure. Also, the incoming rent from your home property will cover your rental cost in Asia by a factor of 3 in most cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        We understand that clients like to feel they are secure in their rental property, and don’t want to have to move from a property they feel comfortable in, so we came up with a solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have offered landlords the option of getting approximately 1k Euro per year on top of the rent for a long term contract. So if a client is happy in a rented property after six months, we would approach the landlord and offer them a 10 year contract for 10k up front, plus the rent paid monthly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Thais will grab the 10k with both hands.</p> 
        <p>Now the client knows they are safe in this property for a 10 year period as an example, which only cost them 10k, and that’s the total risk.</p>
       <p>That keeps life very simple and stress free.</p>

    Accommodation in The Philippines
  </h3>

  <div class="row d-flex justify-content-between my-5 ">
    <div class="p-lg-5 p-2 col-12 bg-white rounded-2 shadow align-self-center">
<p>
  In Cebu, there is no real possibility of renting a 3 bedroom villa in a suitable location, and the only option in most cases is a quality apartment close to the IT and Business park areas of the city, where you have all modern conveniences within walking distance.
</p>
<p>
  Again all quality apartment complexes have very good communal swimming pool facilities.
</p>
<p>
  There isn’t much more to say about accommodation in Cebu, apart from the fact that a lot of apartments can be small in size, and it's our job to find the larger and more comfortable ones on behalf of our clients.
</p>
<p>
  Also, quality apartments are a little more expensive than in Thailand.
