                    Tony retired from teaching as a single divorced guy at the age of 62, and was finding it difficult to pass the time in his retirement. 
                    He played golf a couple of times a week weather permitting, but found the evenings and weeks dragging.

                <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3 ">
                    He had always thought about the idea of travelling in his retirement, 
                    but at the same time he found it hard to motivate himself because he didn’t like the idea of travelling alone.

                    One evening while searching the internet he came across <b>Asia Companion Relocations</b>, and made contact.
                    That was 14 months ago now, and for the past 12 months he has been living in a 3 bedroom house with a private pool in East Pattaya,Thailand with his new 43 year old girlfriend Anong.

                    Tony joined two local golf societies, and plays with one of them each week, where he has met a good social circle who are all in the same boat as himself. 
                    They also meet up for a few beers a couple of times per week.

                John is a 74 year old widower from Harrogate in The UK who lost his wife 4 years ago after 45 years of marriage.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3 ">
                He was a lost soul after his wife passed away, but had reasonable health, and he didn’t want to be a burden on his two adult children, even though they never made him feel he was a burden.

            A friend of his told him about <b>Asia Companion Relocations.com</b>, that provide quality independent two bedroom rental apartments in Thailand and The Philippines as well as English speaking companion nurse assistants.
          </p>

          <p class=" bigger">
            After some research, he decided to rent out his own house in The UK for a year, and try life in Cebu, which was a brave decision at his age, but he felt he didn’t have a lot to lose.
        </p>

          <p class=" bigger mb-lg-0 mb-3">
            He was introduced to Grace online, who is a 50 year old assistant nurse, and two years later they are getting on very well together.

              Our team organised every last detail of John’s relocation. We found his apartment, introduced him to Grace, met him at the airport, made sure he had adequate private health insurance, and even introduced him to other expats in Cebu who meet often for a few beers to play cards or watch matches and to try to put the world to rights!
              His apartment is also within 5 minutes of the best private hospital in Cebu, if not the Philippines.

              We even connected his phone to the television in his apartment so that he can make video calls to his two adult kids and grandchildren on the TV, which he does twice a week, and his family love chatting to Grace too.

            Trevor retired as a police sergeant at 59 years of age and was divorced for the past 15 years. He had a couple of relationships in that period of time, but none of them worked out.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3 ">
            He is now a grandfather and has a great relationship with his son and daughter, as well as his three grandkids, but they lead very busy lives, and he doesn’t want to be interfering, by trying to spend too much time with them, even though he loves kids.
          </p>
          <p>When he was offered the potential opportunity to take on a young single Mom and kid/s, he gave it serious consideration for a couple of months.</p>
          <p>The idea that over the next 20 years, he could seriously give two or three people the chance of a lifestyle they would never otherwise get, really appealed to him and would give him a real purpose in life, as well as keeping him young at heart, at the same time.</p>
          <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3">He looked at what budget he could afford, and how far that budget would take a new family, and you can see his findings here:</p>

            When asked if he would consider returning to The UK, he says he is as happy as he can be where he is for the moment at his age, and the future will look after itself. 
            After two years, he is very confident that Grace will look after him to his final day whenever that comes, if he wants her too and that seems like a much better option than paying well over 4k STG per month to be put in a nursing home in The UK.
