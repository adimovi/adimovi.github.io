                    Tony retired from teaching as a single divorced guy at the age of 62, and was finding it difficult to pass the time in his retirement. 
                    He played golf a couple of times a week weather permitting, but found the evenings and weeks dragging.

                <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3 ">
                    He had always thought about the idea of travelling in his retirement, 
                    but at the same time he found it hard to motivate himself because he didn’t like the idea of travelling alone.

                    One evening while searching the internet he came across <b>Asia Companion Relocations</b>, and made contact.
                    That was 14 months ago now, and for the past 12 months he has been living in a 3 bedroom house with a private pool in East Pattaya,Thailand with his new 43 year old girlfriend Anong.

                    Tony joined two local golf societies, and plays with one of them each week, where he has met a good social circle who are all in the same boat as himself. 
                    They also meet up for a few beers a couple of times per week.

                    When asked if he was happy, or would consider moving back to The UK, Tony is adamant that he would never move back, because he has a much better lifestyle in Pattaya than he could ever afford in The UK.

            <p class="mb-lg-0 bigger mb-3 ">
                He was a lost soul after his wife passed away, but had reasonable health, and he didn’t want to be a burden on his two adult children, even though they never made him feel he was a burden.

            A friend of his told him about <b>Asia Companion Relocations.com</b>, that provide quality independent two bedroom rental apartments in Thailand and The Philippines as well as English speaking companion nurse assistants.
          </p>

          <p class=" bigger">
            After some research, he decided to rent out his own house in The UK for a year, and try life in Cebu, which was a brave decision at his age, but he felt he didn’t have a lot to lose.

              We even connected his phone to the television in his apartment so that he can make video calls to his two adult kids and grandchildren on the TV, which he does twice a week, and his family love chatting to Grace too.

              John’s life isn’t perfect, but he feels a hell of a lot better than he did in the UK in the cold dark winters on his own walking around the house he shared with his wife. Now he also enjoys a swim in the complex pool every day with Grace.

              When asked if he would consider returning to The UK, he says he is as happy as he can be where he is for the moment at his age, and the future will look after itself. 
              After two years, he is very confident that Grace will look after him to his final day whenever that comes, if he wants her too and that seems like a much better option than paying well over 4k STG per month to be put in a nursing home in The UK.
