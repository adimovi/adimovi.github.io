              <b>Mature Companions</b> are exactly how Tony’s story goes on the home page.
There are many potential fit single companions in their late 30’s, early 40s, who had a family when they were very young, and whose kids have already fled the nest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because of Asian culture, many of them believe they are gone beyond the dating age, but they have a huge amount of love, support and more to offer the right partner.</p>

            <p class=" mb-0">
              They also work long hours for very bad salaries just to survive, and would be extremely appreciative if any DECENT & RESPECTABLE human being offered them an alternative lifestyle option.
            </p>
            <p>
              We have seen many cases first hand where two people’s lives have been completely changed for the better, and we intend to create many more in the future.</p>

            <p class=" mb-0">
              This is a big move for someone from western society for sure, but we have never seen anyone return home who met the right partner and was organised properly in the first place.</p>

                <b>Nurse Companions:</b><br>
The first thing we need to point out here is that even though we refer to nurse companions, they are actually qualified nurses aides, and not fully qualified nurses.
We can also provide fully qualified nurses, if required by a client.
              </p>
              
  
              <p class="bold mb-0">
                Could a nurse companion become a dating companion?
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course that is a possibility, but for sure not expected and any client who requires a nurse companion is obligated to provide a separate bedroom.</p>
  
              <p class="bold mb-0">
                What are the obligations of a live-in nurse companion?
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike other live-in nurse providers, we expect our nurse companions to be happy to attend social functions with our clients or go on excursions, as requested, as well as look after the home and whatever medical needs they are qualified to execute.
                We look for good empathic natured nurse companions who have a very warm and positive type of attitude to life.</p>

                <b>Single Mom Companions:</b><br>
Dating a younger single Mom is not for everyone, but at the same time can be a very rewarding experience for the right gentleman, just like in Trevor’s story on the home page, who found serious purpose to his life in his early 60s.
              </p>
              <p>
                This section is more complicated for a few reasons.
The first is that we charge double the normal fees for guys who are interested in offering a single Mom and her kid/s a quality life. 
The reason for this is that we double down big time on our research into the background checks of both the guy and single Mom for safety reasons, especially with kids involved.
</p>
  
              <p class=" mb-0">
                The initial dating stage is also different, because both parties need to form a relationship together without the kids first, and also they need to discuss carefully about their priorities for child rearing. We assist with this part by providing a lot of important questions that both parties need to discuss to make sure they are on the same page.</p>
              <p>
                You would think that the only concern is for the children, but another big concern for us is to ensure that a guy doesn’t end up very emotionally attached to the kid/s and then the Mom decides to split up.</p>
  
              <p class=" mb-0">
                That’s why we look into the single Mom’s background very carefully too.
