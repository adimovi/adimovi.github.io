                  <h3 class="bold mt-lg-0 mt-3 mb-3">Barry Murphy from Ireland is the founder of Asia Companion Locations.com, and here is why he created this business in his own words:</h3>
                  <p>As a single guy who ran my own businesses for 30 years, and now retired in my late 50s, I decided to spend some time in Asia to figure out if I would like to settle there. And if so where?</p>
                  <p class="mb-lg-0 mb-3">I spent over a month in each of 5 different locations in Thailand and The Philippines, which taught me an awful lot more about the expats that are living in these places, rather than the locals. 
                    I doubled back to two of the best locations afterwards to recruit quality assistants and conduct some serious research.</p>

            <img src="./imgs/home/barry2.jpg" class="d-block mx-auto px-lg-0 px-3" style="width: 100%;" >
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row rounded-2 shadow  mx-lg-5 mx-2 bg-white my-5 slide-in-left">
          <div class="p-lg-5 p-4 col-12  align-self-center">
                  <p>I spoke to hundreds of expats on my travels, and I realised that they fall into two main categories.</p>
                  <p>The first category is those who have very limited financial resources and are only there because the cost of living is so cheap, that they have no option. Many, but not all of these guys are ex US military,
                     on modest pensions, and are usually living, or more to the point, just about existing in the cheapest areas of Asia.</p>
                     <p>
                      The second category is guys who have a monthly income above 3k, which they often put together by renting out their home in the west, plus their pension.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      These guys can afford a very decent lifestyle in quality areas of Asia, but many if not most of them continuously make the same mistakes over and over again:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      1. They pay too much money for accommodation, which is not always as good as it could be, and they end up signing lease agreements that are not in their best interests.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      2. They often date partners over and over again who also do not have their best interests at heart, which leads to all kinds of unnecessary drama.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      3. In many cases their health insurance policies are either inadequate or unsuitable for their new location.
                     </p>

                     <p>
                      I met so many very decent guys in their 60s and 70s with a reasonable income who are not living the best life they could,
                       with the resources they have, which is very sad, and in many cases they are isolated and soulless living in Asia, which was never their intention.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I decided that it was time to put together a plan on all of the above three fronts to improve the lives of these guys and also for guys who might like to relocate to Asia, where one can definitely enjoy a much better lifestyle affordably.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So, here is what I did step by step:
                     </p>
                     <p class="bold mb-0">
                      1. Property rentals:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I hired a very experienced expat property manager in each location.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      I interviewed estate agent after estate agent, until I found the most reliable and trustworthy in both locations I selected.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      This gave me the confidence that we would always be able to offer clients the very best rental rates and properties on the market at any given time to suit their needs, which can often vary.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      (Please check out the <a href="accomodations.html">Accommodation</a> tab in the menu, which explains why expats should never buy a property in Asia, and at the same time feel confident that they can stay in a rented property for as long as they wish, and how to do it)
                     </p>

                     <p class="bold mb-0">
                      2. Dating:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Many of the expats are hanging out in expat areas, and these locations attract certain types of potential local partners, which are definitely not who you want for a long term decent relationship in most cases.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      Some expats use dating apps, which again in many cases attract the wrong type of partners and are extremely time wasting for anyone looking for a serious genuine relationship, again in most cases.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      The truth is that real quality partners are not in these locations, nor are they on any dating apps, and I had to figure out a way to find them, which i believe I did by recruiting  small teams of local HR professionals in different areas of each country to help.
                     </p>

                     <p class="bold mb-0">
                      3. Health Insurance:
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I heard lots of horror stories of guys who thought they had adequate health insurance to cover private hospitals, only to find out when it was too late that they didn’t read the small print.<br class="d-lg-block d-none">
                      I hired one medical specialist who collaborates with specialists in The UK, USA, Australia, The Philippines and Thailand to figure out exactly what type of policies would work best for our clients on a case by case basis, taking into account their existing cover if they have any.
                     </p>


                     <h3 class="bold mb-0">
                      Concierge Services:
                     </h3>
                     <p>
                      The last part of the puzzle was to find a good reliable concierge specialist who would sort out issues like airport transfers, meeting incoming clients upon arrival, 
                      showing them around their new location, assisting with things like visa applications, sports club memberships and introducing them to other expat social groups.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The question I needed to continuously ask myself was if I would be happy to have a loved one in my own family 
                      travel and relocate to Asia alone safely and comfortably, and after a lot of time, work and money spent, I believe I have passed my own test.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      There will always be small issues to be dealt with, but I firmly believe we have the backup to deal with them, 
                      and the biggest issue facing clients will be getting their affairs in order in their country of origin before they leave, rather than when they arrive in Asia.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I would strongly recommend that clients look at this move as a one year plan initially, 
                      which means not renting out their original home for more than a one year period, in case they would prefer to return for whatever reason.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      To check out the location I selected in The Philippines and the location in Thailand, and why, go to the “Locations” page in the menu, or <a href="locations.html">click here</a>.
                     </p>

                     <p class="mb-0">
                      The truth is that I consider myself a very lucky guy, or maybe it was because of hard work, but I don’t need to work for a living at all anymore. 
                      At the same time, it’s nice to create a business that is very rewarding which provides a quality affordable service that seriously benefits our clients.
                     </p>
          </div>

        <div class="row rounded-2 shadow mx-lg-5 mx-2 bg-white my-5 slide-in-left">
          <div class="p-lg-5 p-4 col-12  align-self-center">
          <h3 class="bold text-center">
            Warning:
          </h3>
          <p>
            I personally interview every potential incoming client by phone or video call, because despite 
            the fact that we can assist with dating companions or nursing companions, it is important to understand that money will only get a client a quality companion, but it takes respect and appreciation to hold on to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            To put this in very blunt terms, we do not accept clients who are assholes that believe they somehow own a companion for a few hundred Euro per month, or have any intention of treating them with anything other than the highest level of decency and respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, there could be a personality clash, and we might need to replace a companion, but it must never be because of disrespect.
            <br class="d-lg-block d-none">
            (Sorry for the strong words, but this is seriously important, as I’m sure you can understand)
          </p>
          <p>
            I, and the quality team of assistants I have put together look forward to the opportunity to look after all of your relocation needs to the very best of our ability.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-0">
